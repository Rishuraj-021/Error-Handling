# Error-Handling
## üéØ Aim:

To implement structured error handling in C++ using exceptions for safer and more reliable programs.
## üìö Theory:

Error handling is a vital part of software development that ensures programs can detect and respond to unexpected conditions without crashing. In C++, this is achieved through exception handling, which separates error detection from error resolution.
Key Concepts:

    Try Block: Wraps code that might throw an exception.

    Throw Statement: Signals an error condition.

    Catch Block: Handles the thrown exception and defines recovery actions.

Exception Propagation:

When an exception is thrown, control jumps to the nearest matching catch block. If no match is found, the program terminates. This mechanism supports layered error handling across functions and modules.
Standard Exception Classes:

C++ provides a rich hierarchy of exception classes:

    std::exception: Base class for all standard exceptions.

    std::runtime_error, std::logic_error: For runtime and logical errors.

    Specialized classes like std::out_of_range, std::bad_alloc, etc.

Custom Exceptions:

Developers can define their own exception classes to represent domain-specific errors, enhancing clarity and modularity.
Best Practices:

    Use exceptions only for truly exceptional conditions.

    Catch exceptions by reference to avoid slicing.

    Use RAII and smart pointers for automatic resource cleanup.

    Avoid catching overly broad exceptions unless necessary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm:

    Start the program.

    Identify risky operations (e.g., division, file access, memory allocation).

    Wrap risky code in a try block to monitor for exceptions.

    Use throw statements to raise exceptions when an error condition is detected.

    Implement catch blocks to handle specific exceptions.

    Display appropriate error messages or take corrective actions.

    Continue execution or terminate gracefully depending on the severity.

    End the program.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion:

Exception handling in C++ is a powerful tool for managing runtime errors effectively. It promotes cleaner code, better separation of concerns, and more resilient applications. By mastering try-catch-throw constructs and following best practices, developers can ensure their programs handle failures gracefully, improving user experience and system stability.
